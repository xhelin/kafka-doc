# 3. Configuration

Kafka uses key-value pairs in the [property file format](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.properties) for configuration. These values can be supplied either from a file or programmatically.

## 3.1 Broker Configs

The essential configurations are the following:

* broker.id
* log.dirs
* zookeeper.connect

Topic-level configurations and defaults are discussed in more detail [below](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config).

|Property|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
| broker.id                                     |                    | Each broker is uniquely identified by a non-negative integer id. This id serves as the broker's "name" and allows the broker to be moved to a different host/port without confusing consumers. You can choose any number you like so long as it is unique.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| log.dirs                                      | /tmp/kafka-logs    | A comma-separated list of one or more directories in which Kafka data is stored. Each new partition that is created will be placed in the directory which currently has the fewest partitions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| zookeeper.connect                             | null               | Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form hostname:port, where hostname and port are the host and port for a node in your ZooKeeper cluster. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that host is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form<br />`hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3.`<br /><br />ZooKeeper also allows you to add a "chroot" path which will make all kafka data for this cluster appear under a particular path. This is a way to setup multiple Kafka clusters or other applications on the same ZooKeeper cluster. To do this give a connection string in the form<br />`hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`<br /><br />which would put all this cluster's data under the path `/chroot/path`. Note that you must create this path yourself prior to starting the broker and consumers must use the same connection string. |
| message.max.bytes                             | 1000000            | The maximum size of a message that the server can receive. It is important that this property be in sync with the maximum fetch size your consumers use or else an unruly producer will be able to publish messages too large for consumers to consume.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| log.cleaner.min.cleanable.ratio               | 0.5                | This configuration controls how frequently the log compactor will attempt to clean the log (assuming [log compaction](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) is enabled). By default we will avoid cleaning a log where more than 50% of the log has been compacted. This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by duplicates (at 50% at most 50% of the log could be duplicates). A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log. This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis (see [the per-topic configuration section](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

This setting also gives a bound on the time in which a consumer must complete a read if they begin from offset 0 to ensure that they get a valid snapshot of the final stage (otherwise delete tombstones may be collected before they complete their scan). This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis (see [the per-topic configuration section](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

Note that we will always pre-allocate a sparse file with this much space and shrink it down when the log rolls. If the index fills up we will roll a new log segment even if we haven't reached the log.segment.bytes limit. This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis (see [the per-topic configuration section](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config)).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| log.index.interval.bytes                      | 4096               | The byte interval at which we add an entry to the offset index. When executing a fetch request the server must do a linear scan for up to this many bytes to find the correct position in the log to begin and end the fetch. So setting this value to be larger will mean larger index files (and a bit more memory usage) but less scanning. However the server will never add more than one index entry per log append (even if more than log.index.interval worth of messages are appended). In general you probably don't need to mess with this value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| log.flush.interval.messages                   | None               | The number of messages written to a log partition before we force an fsync on the log. Setting this lower will sync data to disk more often but will have a major impact on performance. We generally recommend that people make use of replication for durability rather than depending on single-server fsync, however this setting can be used to be extra certain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

### Topic-level configuration

Configurations pertinent to topics have both a global default as well an optional per-topic override. If no per-topic configuration is given the global default is used. The override can be set at topic creation time by giving one or more --config options. This example creates a topic named my-topic with a custom max message size and flush rate:

	> bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --create --topic my-topic --partitions 1 
        --replication-factor 1 --config max.message.bytes=64000 --config flush.messages=1
        
Overrides can also be changed or set later using the alter topic command. This example updates the max message size for my-topic:
	
	> bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic 
    	--config max.message.bytes=128000
    	
To remove an override you can do
	
	> bin/kafka-topics.sh --zookeeper localhost:2181 --alter --topic my-topic 
    --deleteConfig max.message.bytes

The following are the topic-level configurations. The server's default configuration for this property is given under the Server Default Property heading, setting this default in the server config allows you to change the default given to topics that have no override specified.

| Property | Default | Server Default Property | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------------------|-------------|
| cleanup.policy            | delete              | log.cleanup.policy              | A string that is either "delete" or "compact". This string designates the retention policy to use on old log segments. The default policy ("delete") will discard old segments when their retention time or size limit has been reached. The "compact" setting will enable [log compaction](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) on the topic.                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| delete.retention.ms       | 86400000 (24 hours) | log.cleaner.delete.retention.ms | The amount of time to retain delete tombstone markers for [log compacted](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) topics. This setting also gives a bound on the time in which a consumer must complete a read if they begin from offset 0 to ensure that they get a valid snapshot of the final stage (otherwise delete tombstones may be collected before they complete their scan).                                                                                                                                                          |
| flush.messages            | None                | log.flush.interval.messages     | This setting allows specifying an interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1 we would fsync after every message; if it were 5 we would fsync after every five messages. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient. This setting can be overridden on a per-topic basis (see [the per-topic configuration section](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#topic-config)). |
| flush.ms                  | None                | log.flush.interval.ms           | This setting allows specifying a time interval at which we will force an fsync of data written to the log. For example if this was set to 1000 we would fsync after 1000 ms had passed. In general we recommend you not set this and use replication for durability and allow the operating system's background flush capabilities as it is more efficient.                                                                                                                                           |
| index.interval.bytes      | 4096                | log.index.interval.bytes        | This setting controls how frequently Kafka adds an index entry to it's offset index. The default setting ensures that we index a message roughly every 4096 bytes. More indexing allows reads to jump closer to the exact position in the log but makes the index larger. You probably don't need to change this.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| max.message.bytes         | 1,000,000           | message.max.bytes               | This is largest message size Kafka will allow to be appended to this topic. Note that if you increase this size you must also increase your consumer's fetch size so they can fetch messages this large.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| min.cleanable.dirty.ratio | 0.5                 | log.cleaner.min.cleanable.ratio | This configuration controls how frequently the log compactor will attempt to clean the log (assuming [log compaction](http://kafka.apache.org/documentation.html#compaction) is enabled). By default we will avoid cleaning a log where more than 50% of the log has been compacted. This ratio bounds the maximum space wasted in the log by duplicates (at 50% at most 50% of the log could be duplicates). A higher ratio will mean fewer, more efficient cleanings but will mean more wasted space in the log.                                             |
| retention.bytes           | None                | log.retention.bytes             | This configuration controls the maximum size a log can grow to before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete" retention policy. By default there is no size limit only a time limit.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| retention.ms              | 7 days              | log.retention.minutes           | This configuration controls the maximum time we will retain a log before we will discard old log segments to free up space if we are using the "delete" retention policy. This represents an SLA on how soon consumers must read their data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| segment.bytes             | 1 GB                | log.segment.bytes               | This configuration controls the segment file size for the log. Retention and cleaning is always done a file at a time so a larger segment size means fewer files but less granular control over retention.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| segment.index.bytes       | 10 MB               | log.index.size.max.bytes        | This configuration controls the size of the index that maps offsets to file positions. We preallocate this index file and shrink it only after log rolls. You generally should not need to change this setting.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| segment.ms                | 7 days              | log.roll.hours                  | This configuration controls the period of time after which Kafka will force the log to roll even if the segment file isn't full to ensure that retention can delete or compact old data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

## 3.2 Consumer Configs

The essential consumer configurations are the following:

* group.id
* zookeeper.connect

|Property|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
| group.id                        |                | A string that uniquely identifies the group of consumer processes to which this consumer belongs. By setting the same group id multiple processes indicate that they are all part of the same consumer group.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| zookeeper.connect               |                | Specifies the ZooKeeper connection string in the form hostname:port where host and port are the host and port of a ZooKeeper server. To allow connecting through other ZooKeeper nodes when that ZooKeeper machine is down you can also specify multiple hosts in the form <br />`hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3`.<br /><br />The server may also have a ZooKeeper chroot path as part of it's ZooKeeper connection string which puts its data under some path in the global ZooKeeper namespace. If so the consumer should use the same chroot path in its connection string. For example to give a chroot path of `/chroot/path` you would give the connection string as <br />`hostname1:port1,hostname2:port2,hostname3:port3/chroot/path`. |

### 3.3 Producer Configs

Essential configuration properties for the producer include:

* metadata.broker.list
* request.required.acks
* producer.type
* serializer.class
 
|Property|Default|Description|
|--------|-------|-----------|
| metadata.broker.list               |                                   | This is for bootstrapping and the producer will only use it for getting metadata (topics, partitions and replicas). The socket connections for sending the actual data will be established based on the broker information returned in the metadata. The format is host1:port1,host2:port2, and the list can be a subset of brokers or a VIP pointing to a subset of brokers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| request.required.acks              | 0                                 | This value controls when a produce request is considered completed. Specifically, how many other brokers must have committed the data to their log and acknowledged this to the leader? Typical values are<br /> * 0, which means that the producer never waits for an acknowledgement from the broker (the same behavior as 0.7). This option provides the lowest latency but the weakest durability guarantees (some data will be lost when a server fails). <br /> * 1, which means that the producer gets an acknowledgement after the leader replica has received the data. This option provides better durability as the client waits until the server acknowledges the request as successful (only messages that were written to the now-dead leader but not yet replicated will be lost). <br /> * -1, which means that the producer gets an acknowledgement after all in-sync replicas have received the data. This option provides the best durability, we guarantee that no messages will be lost as long as at least one in sync replica remains. |

| producer.type                      | sync                              | This parameter specifies whether the messages are sent asynchronously in a background thread. Valid values are (1) async for asynchronous send and (2) sync for synchronous send. By setting the producer to async we allow batching together of requests (which is great for throughput) but open the possibility of a failure of the client machine dropping unsent data.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

If you set this to zero, the metadata will get refreshed after each message sent (not recommended).

### 3.4 New Producer Configs

We are working on a replacement for our existing producer. The code is available in trunk now and can be considered beta quality. Below is the configuration for the new producer.

|Name|Type|Default|Importance|Description|
|----|----|-------|----------|-----------|
| bootstrap.servers         | list    |          | high   | A list of host/port pairs to use for establishing the initial connection to the Kafka cluster. Data will be load balanced over all servers irrespective of which servers are specified here for bootstrapping—this list only impacts the initial hosts used to discover the full set of servers. This list should be in the form `host1:port1,host2:port2`,.... Since these servers are just used for the initial connection to discover the full cluster membership (which may change dynamically), this list need not contain the full set of servers (you may want more than one, though, in case a server is down). If no server in this list is available sending data will fail until on becomes available.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| acks                      | string  | 1        | high   | The number of acknowledgments the producer requires the leader to have received before considering a request complete. This controls the durability of records that are sent. The following settings are common: <br /> * acks=0 If set to zero then the producer will not wait for any acknowledgment from the server at all. The record will be immediately added to the socket buffer and considered sent. No guarantee can be made that the server has received the record in this case, and the retries configuration will not take effect (as the client won't generally know of any failures). The offset given back for each record will always be set to -1. <br /> * acks=1 This will mean the leader will write the record to its local log but will respond without awaiting full acknowledgement from all followers. In this case should the leader fail immediately after acknowledging the record but before the followers have replicated it then the record will be lost. <br /> * acks=all This means the leader will wait for the full set of in-sync replicas to acknowledge the record. This guarantees that the record will not be lost as long as at least one in-sync replica remains alive. This is the strongest available guarantee. <br /> * Other settings such as acks=2 are also possible, and will require the given number of acknowledgements but this is generally less useful. |
| buffer.memory             | long    | 33554432 | high   | The total bytes of memory the producer can use to buffer records waiting to be sent to the server. If records are sent faster than they can be delivered to the server the producer will either block or throw an exception based on the preference specified by block.on.buffer.full.<br /><br />This setting should correspond roughly to the total memory the producer will use, but is not a hard bound since not all memory the producer uses is used for buffering. Some additional memory will be used for compression (if compression is enabled) as well as for maintaining in-flight requests.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| compression.type          | string  | none     | high   | The compression type for all data generated by the producer. The default is none (i.e. no compression). Valid values are none, gzip, or snappy. Compression is of full batches of data, so the efficacy of batching will also impact the compression ratio (more batching means better compression).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| retries                   | int     | 0        | high   | Setting a value greater than zero will cause the client to resend any record whose send fails with a potentially transient error. Note that this retry is no different than if the client resent the record upon receiving the error. Allowing retries will potentially change the ordering of records because if two records are sent to a single partition, and the first fails and is retried but the second succeeds, then the second record may appear first.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| batch.size                | int     | 16384    | medium | The producer will attempt to batch records together into fewer requests whenever multiple records are being sent to the same partition. This helps performance on both the client and the server. This configuration controls the default batch size in bytes.<br /><br /> No attempt will be made to batch records larger than this size.<br /><br /> Requests sent to brokers will contain multiple batches, one for each partition with data available to be sent.<br /><br /> A small batch size will make batching less common and may reduce throughput (a batch size of zero will disable batching entirely). A very large batch size may use memory a bit more wastefully as we will always allocate a buffer of the specified batch size in anticipation of additional records.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| client.id                 | string  |          | medium | The id string to pass to the server when making requests. The purpose of this is to be able to track the source of requests beyond just ip/port by allowing a logical application name to be included with the request.

| linger.ms                 | long    | 0        | medium | The producer groups together any records that arrive in between request transmissions into a single batched request. Normally this occurs only under load when records arrive faster than they can be sent out. However in some circumstances the client may want to reduce the number of requests even under moderate load. This setting accomplishes this by adding a small amount of artificial delay—that is, rather than immediately sending out a record the producer will wait for up to the given delay to allow other records to be sent so that the sends can be batched together. This can be thought of as analogous to Nagle's algorithm in TCP. This setting gives the upper bound on the delay for batching: once we get batch.size worth of records for a partition it will be sent immediately regardless of this setting, however if we have fewer than this many bytes accumulated for this partition we will 'linger' for the specified time waiting for more records to show up. This setting defaults to 0 (i.e. no delay). Setting `linger.ms=5`, for example, would have the effect of reducing the number of requests sent but would add up to 5ms of latency to records sent in the absense of load.                                                                                                                                                         |
| max.request.size          | int     | 1048576  | medium | The maximum size of a request. This is also effectively a cap on the maximum record size. Note that the server has its own cap on record size which may be different from this.
